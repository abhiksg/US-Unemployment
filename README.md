I explored the `jobs` DataFrame containing unemployment rate time series data for 16 industries in the USA from 2000 to 2010, with 122 monthly timepoints. After reading in the data and checking for missing values, I performed time series decomposition on multiple time series within the dataset. To store the results of each decomposition, I utilized a Python dictionary, with the industry names as keys and the corresponding decomposition outputs (trend, seasonality, and residuals) as values. This approach allowed me to analyze the underlying patterns and characteristics of unemployment rates across different industries over the decade, enabling further investigations into trends, seasonal patterns, and potential anomalies within the time series data.
